# Vanilla JS Portfolio
This is a HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript web portfolio.
## Steps Involved

I started this project with the guidance of a coding mentorship company called [Get Coding](https://www.get-coding.ca/). Unfortunately, I never got to complete the entire website due to a new position as a junior web developer with a local marketing company. However, I did get the chance to build the bases of the website and create my first audio project, which was a web audio player. I designed the audio player in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and used the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to code the player's functionality. The web player allows the user to pan the audio left and right and adjust the music player's volume. Another interesting fact is that all the music in the project is my original music.

## Future Steps
To complete the last two projects and all design the landing page for the site.
